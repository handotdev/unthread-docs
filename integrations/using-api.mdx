title: "Using the API (Beta)"
---

Unthread provides a RESTful API for accessing your conversations and analytics.
The API is currently in Beta and is not fully stable. Additional endpoints will
be exposed on an ongoing basis. If you require functionality that is not
currently exposed, please reach out to your account manager to create a feature
request.

## Create a service account

In order to call the API you will first need to create a service account. Go to
your Unthread dashboard and find the Service Accounts tab under Settings. Click
“Add service account”, give your service account a name, and click “Submit”.

After creating the new service account, you will see a window displaying the
service account’s API key. Copy this key and put it somewhere safe and secret.
Once you close the window you will not be able to view the key again.

## Calling the API

The URL for calls to the API will have the following form, with ${endpoint}
being replaced by the endpoint you are trying to call:

```jsx
https://api.unthread.io/api/${endpoint}
```

In order to authenticate, you must send an HTTP header with the key “X-Api-Key”
and the value set to the service account key created in the previous section.
All request and response bodies will be in JSON.

## Exposed endpoints

### List Conversations

```jsx
POST / conversations / list;
```

This endpoint will return a list of conversations. Requests are made in the
following format:

```tsx
interface Where {
  field: string;
  operator: "==" | "!=" | ">" | "<";
  value: string | number;
}

interface ConversationListRequest {
  cursor?: string;
  order?: Array<"status" | "updatedAt" | "createdAt">;
  limit?: number;
  descending?: boolean;
  where?: Array<Where>;
}
```

Accepted values for the where field are `customerId`, `status`, `createdAt` and
`updatedAt`. Responses are made in the following format:

```tsx
interface Message {
  ts: string;
  userId: string;
  userTeamId: string;
  botId: string;
  botName: string;
  fullContent: string;
  subtype: string | null;
}

interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  status: "open" | "in_progress" | "on_hold" | "closed";
  customerId: string | null;
  channelId: string;
  wasManuallyCreated: boolean;
  friendlyId: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  closedAt: string | null;
  responseTime: number | null;
  responseTimeWorking: number | null;
  resolutionTime: number | null;
  resolutionTimeWorking: number | null;
  initialMessage: Message;
}

interface ConversationListResponse {
  data: Array<Conversation>;
  totalCount: number;
  cursors: {
    hasNext: boolean;
    hasPrevious: boolean;
    next: string;
    previous: string;
  };
}
```

Responses from this endpoint are paginated by providing a cursor to the next or
previous page. The limit per page is 100 conversations.

### Reporting

```jsx
POST / reporting / time - series;
```

This endpoint will return metrics about your conversations. Requests are made in
the following format:

```tsx
type Metric =
  | "totalCount"
  | "responseTimeMean"
  | "responseTimeWorkingMean"
  | "resolutionTimeMean"
  | "resolutionTimeWorkingMean"
  | "conversationsResolved";
type DateDimension = "day" | "week" | "month";
type Dimension = "assigneeId" | "customerId" | "tagId" | "sourceType";

interface ReportingTimeSeriesRequest {
  timezone?: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  dateDimension: DateDimension;
  metric: Metric;
  dimensions?: Dimension[];
  filters?: {
    [dim: Dimension]: string | string[];
  };
}
```

- The `timezone` field is optional and defaults to “UTC”.
- `starDate` and `endDate` have the following format: “2022-12-31”. The dates
  are inclusive.
- `dateDimension` specifies in what time period the data should be grouped by.
- All metrics are numbers. Response and resolution times are in seconds.
- `dimensions` is an array of fields to group the data by in addition to date.
- `filters` allows you to filter the data to specific dimensions. If an array is
  passed for a given dimension then it is treated as an `OR`.

Responses are returned in the following format:

```tsx
type Dimension = "assigneeId" | "customerId" | "tagId" | "sourceType";

type DataSplit = {
  [key: string]: DataPoint;
};
type DataPoint = number | DataSplit;

interface ReportingTimeSeriesResponse {
  data: DataSplit;
  dates: string[];
  lookups: {
    [dim: Dimension]: {
      [key: string]: string;
    };
  };
}
```

- If there is no data for a particular day then that day will not be included in
  the `data` object, however it will be included in the `dates` array.
- If dimensions are included in the request, then the data will be nested for
  each dimension included. Dimensions are nested in the order they are included
  in the request. See the example below for clarification.
- `dates` is an array of the time periods covered by the query. For grouping on
  weeks, each value in the array is the first day of the week starting on
  Monday. For grouping on months, each value in the array is the first day of
  the month.
- `lookups` contains friendly names for the keys contained in `data`. For
  example, if grouping by `customerId`, the lookups would contain a mapping of
  the customer ID to the customer name.

An example request and response is included below:

```javascript javascript
// Request
// POST /reporting/time-series
{
  "dateDimension": "week",
	"startDate": "2022-12-01",
	"endDate": "2022-12-31",
	"metric": "totalCount",
	"timezone": "America/New_York",
	"filters": {
		"assigneeId": [
			"63335fa9-ffcc-4103-8905-e4440cc7c7d4",
			"2e8dab53-a7a2-4e1f-b9d9-66018b98365d"
		]
	},
	"dimensions": ["customerId", "sourceType"]
}
