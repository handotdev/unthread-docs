title: "Email to Slack Connector"

Unthread allows you to relay support emails to your Slack channel, and you can
respond to customers directly from Slack. This means you never need to open
Outlook or Gmail again 🙌

Head over to “Settings” > “Email” from your Unthread dashboard, and then keep
reading!

## 🛠 Setting up the connector

The first step is to forward messages from an email address into Slack. That
way, your entire team has context, and you can use assignment rules to notify
the right responder.

## Set up email forwarding

First, choose a name for the support email group, something like “{Company}
Support” will do just fine!

Then, add the email address that you use to receive support emails. You should
have already set this up via your email provider.

Lastly, set up email forwarding to the Unthread email that’s in the dashboard.
This is the trickiest step!

Follow these steps to enable forwarding, depending on which email provider you
use:

- [Gmail / Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4524505#address-map-forwarding)
  - Please follow the instructions under “Forward messages with address maps”.
    The instructions under “Forward messages with Gmail automatic forwarding”
    are not currently supported.
- [Outlook / Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/forward-email-from-office-365-to-another-email-account-1ed4ee1e-74f8-4f53-a174-86b748ff6a0e)

<Note>
📖 Some common mistakes to double-check:
• Be sure to follow the steps in those guides rather than use a Google Group. It’ll be more reliable this way and is worth the effort!
• Be sure that your support email “support@{yourdomain}.com” matches exactly what you enter into the Unthread dashboard
• Double-check that you’ve entered the unthread email (should look something like “{domain}-unthread-u9hd0@mail.unthread.io” is entered in your email forwarding setup

</Note>

## Choose a Slack channel

Select a channel from the dropdown, and the email contents will be posted there.
For your channel to appear, it must be an internal channel (not a Slack Connect
or shared channel).

## Set up assignment rules

Inbound emails can have their own assignment rules that you configure on this
page. This is important because the email may not match an existing customer, so
you’ll need to determine how to assign those messages.

## 📨 Managing emails in Slack

Once setup, you’ll start seeing email content posted directly to your Slack
channel. How great is that!

## Tracking & assigning new messages

You’ve already set up the assignment rules in the first step, new emails are
[tracked just like any other message](/convosslack/convotrack).
This means you can set up
[escalation paths](/convosslack/assingments)
& SLAs,
[triage messages](/convosslack/triagingissues)
with your team, and more. When a message is assigned to you, it will be in your
[Inbox](/convosslack/managinginbox).

New messages will use the 📩 icon to indicate that the message is from an
inbound email.

## Discussing internally

Unthread will create a thread for the inbound email where you can discuss things
internally. By default, all comments in this thread are private and not shared
with the customer. You’ll see a message like the one below posted with any new
email.

## Sending replies to customers

This is the good stuff and allows you to talk with customers without ever
leaving Slack. Compose your message in the thread that Unthread has created for
you, and when you’re ready to send, include “/unthread send” at the bottom of
the message.

When you include this, the message will be sent to the customer in the same
email thread, and anyone cc’ed on the message will automatically be included.

Here’s how that very reply will look to the customer in the email that they
receive:

Pretty nifty, eh?

## Analytics

You’ll get the same great analytics on response rates and resolution times that
you get with other messages.

In your analytics page, you’ll see email responses broken out based on the name
that you give your support team in the first step. This allows you get reports
on email response rates regardless of whether the person you’re speaking with is
a known customer or not.
