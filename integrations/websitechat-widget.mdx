title: "Website Chat Widget"
---

The in-app chat widget feature allows your customers to get in touch with your
support team from your website. The chat widget will appear as a small icon on
your website, and when a visitor clicks on it, a chat window will open where
they can enter their question or issue. Messages will be posted to Slack and
your team will be able to respond in real time directly from the Slack thread.

There are a few steps to setup the chat widget:

- Enable and configure the widget
- Add the widget code to your website
- (Optional) Verify the identity of logged in users

## Configuring the widget

- Sign in to your Unthread dashboard and navigate to Settings ‚Üí Widget.
- On the settings page, you can customize the appearance of the chat widget,
  including the color and position on your website. You can also customize the
  greeting message that appears when a user first opens the chat. These settings
  can be modified later.
- Select a channel that chat messages will be posted to in Slack.
- Add assignment and escalation rules.
- Once you have customized the chat widget to your liking, click on the "Enable"
  button to generate the code that you will need to add to your website. This
  will also generate an identity verification secret. See below for how to use
  this to verify user identities.

<Note>
‚ú® Configuration settings can be updated remotely without changing any code on your site!

## Adding to your site

- Copy the auto-generated code and paste it into the HTML of your website. The
  code should ideally be placed within the `<head>` tag of your website.
- The widget will be hidden by default. In order to show it, you will need to
  run the following Javascript code somewhere on your website:
  ```jsx
  window.$unthread("start");
  ```
  - This code can either be run immediately after the auto-generated snippet or
    you can wait to run it, for example after the user has logged in.
- The widget should now be visible and ready for use. By default, new users will
  be asked to provide their name and email address before they send their first
  message.
- Optionally, you can pass details about the user when starting up the widget.
  When starting up the widget, pass a user object in the start call:
  ```jsx
  window.$unthread("start", {
    user: {
      name: "John Smith",
      email: "johnsmith@acme.com",
    },
  });
  ```
  - This will automatically set the name and email of the user. They will not be
    prompted to enter those fields themselves when they open the widget.
- If you want to clear the chat history when a user logs out, run the following
  Javascript code on logout:
  ```jsx
  window.$unthread(‚Äôstop‚Äô);
  ```

### Verify the identity of logged in users

- For added security, you can also verify that the email address actually
  belongs to the user. This will require the identity verification secret that
  was generated on the widget settings page. You will also need to be able to
  modify the server side code of your website.
- Copy the identity verification secret and put it somewhere secure that is
  accessible by your website‚Äôs server. This secret should never be exposed on
  the frontend of your website because it can be used to impersonate other
  users.
- When a user logs into your website, you will use the secret to generate an
  HMAC of the user‚Äôs email address. See below on how to generate the HMAC. The
  HMAC should be generated on your server and sent to your frontend as part of
  the login process. The HMAC will be passed as part of the user object passed
  to the start call.
  ```jsx
  window.$unthread("start", {
    user: {
      name: "John Smith",
      email: "johnsmith@acme.com",
      verificationHash: "9l8ugiue98ie9u8ifbmeu897fidhe89u7fi07f",
    },
  });
  ```
- Never send sensitive information to unverified users.
  ### Generating the HMAC verification hash
  How you generate the HMAC verification hash depends on what language you use
  on your server. Here are some examples in different languages:
  **Javascript (Node.js)**
  ```jsx
  const crypto = require("crypto");

  const secret = "<identity-verification-secret>";
  const email = "<email>";

  const verificationHash = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(email)
    .digest("hex");
  ```
  **PHP**
  ```php
  <?php

  $secret = '<identity-verification-secret>';
  $email = '<email>';

  $verification_hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $email, $secret);
  ?>
  ```
  **Ruby**
  ```ruby
  require 'openssl'
  require 'base64'

  secret = '<identity-verification-secret>'
  email = '<email>'

  OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest('sha256', secret, email)
  ```
  **Python**
  ```ruby
  import hashlib
  import hmac
  import base64

  secret = bytes('<identity-verification-secret>', 'utf-8')
  email = bytes('<email>', 'utf-8')

  hash = hmac.new(secret, email, hashlib.sha256)
  hash.hexdigest()
  ```
  ### Unthread SDK
  In addition to `start` and `stop` there are few more functions available in
  the Unthread SDK:
- Toggle the visibility of the chat window:
  ```jsx
  window.$unthread("toggle", "show");
  window.$unthread("toggle", "hide");
  ```
- Toggle the visibility of the message bubble:
  ```jsx
  window.$unthread("toggleBubble", "show");
  window.$unthread("toggleBubble", "hide");
  ```
  ### Chat widget sessions and message history
  If the user has been verified, their full chat history will be available the
  next time they login to your website. If the user has not been verified, their
  chat history will only be available within their current chat session. The
  chat session lasts 1 week from the user‚Äôs last activity within the chat. If
  the user is idle for more than 1 week, their history will be cleared.
  Additionally, if you call the `stop` function in the SDK or the user clears
  their cookies, their chat history will also be cleared.

  <Note>
    üç™ Speaking of cookies: the widget only uses **first-party cookies**,
    meaning they cannot track users across different website and are more
    privacy-centric.
