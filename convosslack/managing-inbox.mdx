The Unthread Inbox is a completely reimagined way of managing conversations across your Slack channels.

To get the most out of your inbox, be sure that you’ve set up the following:

- [Connected your channels](/settingupaccount/addingunthread) to start tracking conversations
- [Set up assignment rules](/convosslack/assignments) to set owners of incoming messages

From the Inbox, you can:

- **Click on a conversation to be right to the channel or thread**
- **Click on the 3 dots to bring up quick actions like [manage conversation](https://www.notion.so/Editing-conversations-reassign-set-priority-add-notes-and-more-a6a70b2122fc4dab9a01f11453e7b9bd), close, snooze, etc.**
- **Click on the gear to manage settings like the sort order, as well as setting a backup rep if you’re out of office.**
- **Click on the graph to bring up your Unthread dashboard to view analytics and adjust your settings**

To navigate to the Inbox, you can select the “Unthread” app from the left nav bar within the Slack application.
