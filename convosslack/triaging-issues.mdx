## What is Triaging?

Triaging is how you take conversations from customer channels and cross-post
them to an internal channel.

When you're managing a conversation in Slack, you'll see a "Triage" button,
which will present you with the option to select an internal channel, optionally
tag a team member, and add a note.

After confirming, the contents of the the thread will be cross-posted to the
channel where your team can work through the details privately. The status badge
will also auto-update based on the status of the ticket.

## Setting up Triage Settings

To set up a default Triage channel, head over to “Settings” > “Slack”, and
you’ll see a dropdown at the top.

You can also set a custom Triage channel per customer by clicking on a customer
profile and navigating to the “Settings” tab on the left.
