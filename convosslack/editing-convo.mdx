The
[Unthread Slack app](/settingupaccount/addingunthread)
has the ability to manage conversation details from a popup. If you see a button
labeled “**Manage conversation**”, it will pop up the following screen:

## Post to Triage channel

Triaging will bring conversations with customers to an internal channel. We’ve
got a
[whole article about that](/convosslack/triagingissues)!

## Snooze

Snoozing a conversation will put it “on hold” until a certain date. It will send
a DM with a custom message at the specified date.

## Assignee

Assigning conversations is a great way to set accountability within your team.
When you assign a message to someone, it will be in their Unthread inbox, and
they’ll get a DM when they are assigned a new message.

## Priority

Set a priority, which can be used as a sort option in your inbox, allowing you
to surface top priority issues first.

## Tags

Tagging conversation will allow you to group conversations around similar
topics. Create, edit, and filter for tags from the homepage of your dashboard.

## Notes

Add custom details about a conversation that will kept private from the
customer. You’ll also see a preview of these notes in your inbox.
