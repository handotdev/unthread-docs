When you
[connect a channel](<(/settingupaccount/addingunthread)>)
to Unthread, we’ll automatically track new conversations as tickets in your
Unthread Inbox and dashboard.

Tickets will automatically be tracked as long as:

- The Unthread app is connected to the channel (it should appear in your
  “Customers” list in the dashboard
- A user who is not a part of your Slack workspace submits a message in the
  channel

Once you start tracking conversations, you’ll want to take a look at some of the
automations that you can configure:

- [Assignments & escalations of conversations](/convosslack/assingments)
  (setting an owner for the ticket)
- [Triaging conversations](/convosslack/triagingissues)
  (bringing them to an internal channel)
- [Editing details](/convosslack/editingconvo)
  (like priority, status, notes, and more)
