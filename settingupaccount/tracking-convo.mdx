title: "Tracking your First Conversation"
---

<Note>
👉 Before you get started, did you [connect to Slack](/settingupaccount/connecting-to-slack) and [add Unthread to a channel](/settingupaccount/adding-unthread)? 
If so, that’s rad, read on!

</Note>

Once you have
[added the Unthread Slack app](/settingupaccount/adding-unthread)
and
[connected it to one of your channels](/settingupaccount/connectingtoslack),
you’ll automatically start seeing conversations tracked in your
[inbox](/convosslack/managing-inbox).

## ⚡️ Automatic tracking

The next time someone outside of your Slack organization sends a message into
the channel, a conversation will be tracked and added to your inbox. For more of
an explanation of automatic tracking, read up on
[how conversations are tracked](/convosslack/convo-track).

## 🔎 Manually tracking conversations

If you’d like to track a conversation now without a customer message, you can
add one manually:

- Hover over a message in a channel
- Click the three dots, and select “Manage conversation”. Note: if you don’t see
  that option, you may need to click “More message shortcuts…”
- A modal will appear with some basic details. Click “Save” and you’ll see it in
  your inbox!

## ℹ️ FAQs

**Someone sent a message in the channel but I don’t see it tracked?**

This may be because of one of two things:

- Only messages from “Customers” (aka someone who’s not in your workspace) are
  tracked. This means if your team member sends something, it won’t be tracked
  as a ticket.
- The channel must have the Unthread app in it. Read up on
  [how to connect your channels](/settingupaccount/adding-unthread).

**Where can I find all of my conversations?** Read through the
[Managing your Inbox](/convosslack/managing-inbox)
page to see where you can find your history of conversations.
