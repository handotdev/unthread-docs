title: "Adding Unthread to your channel"
---

To maximize your privacy, Unthread can only track conversations in channels that
you’ve added us to. This gives you more privacy control, and it requires an
additional step of adding us to the channels you’d like to track. Let’s learn
how!

## Add channels from your Dashboard

Navigate to the “Customers” tab from the left menu, and click the “+ Connect
Channels” button in the upper right corner.

If you’ve connected to Slack, you can search through channels or filter for
shared channels (aka Slack Connect channels). Check the box on the left next to
the channel you’d like to add, and click the “Connect selected channels” button
at the bottom.

<Note>
👉 **Alternatively, you can connect channels from Slack (manually)**
Do this by typing `/add`, selecting “Add apps to this channel”, and selecting the Unthread app.

## Manage your settings

Once you’ve connected a customer channel, you can manage the settings. Some
settings will be automatically filled out, but you can adjust these on a
per-customer basis.

# 🎉 Done!

Nice work. Grab a coffee to celebrate. Or start
[tracking your first conversation](/settingupaccount/tracking-convo)
to see Unthread in action. Up to you, we won’t judge.
