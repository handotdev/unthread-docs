✨ **This is the first step on your Unthread journey**. 
Be sure you complete this step before trying anything else.

## 🚀 Installing the Unthread Slack app

<Note>
ℹ️ **Be sure you have access to your dashboard**
When you sign up for Unthread, we’ll email you a link to your dashboard, which will look something like “{{company}}.unthread.io”, where {{company}} is be your company name. If you can’t find yours, Slack us or email [hello@unthread.io](mailto:hello@unthread.io) and we’ll send it over.

</Note>

Unthread is a Slack app that helps you prioritize customer support requests. You
need to first install the app to your Slack workspace.

From your dashboard, navigate to the “Settings” tab, and locate the “Add to
Slack” button.

This will bring you to a confirmation screen in Slack that asks you to allow
Unthread to access your Slack account.

Click “Allow” and you’re done! You’ll see the app is now live in your Slack
account.

<Note>
➡️ **Next steps**
A great next step from here is to [add Unthread to your first customer channel](/settingupaccount/trackingconvo) to start tracking conversations.

## 🔓 Let’s talk about pri-va-cy, let’s talk about you and me 🎶

Privacy, transparency, and trust are key values here at Unthread. We only
request permissions that we absolutely need to provide the best service to you.
We also only use these permissions in obvious ways that you approve. Here are
some permissions and how we use them:

### The `Perform actions as you` permission

**What we do**: manage channels and channel members so we can add new customers.

**What we don’t do**: we don’t post things pretending to be you.

### The `Content and info about channels & conversations` permission

**What we do**: we listen for messages in channels that you’re tracking so we
can create new tickets, create assignments,

**What we don’t do**: we don’t listen to messages in any other channels (in
fact, this permission are ensures that we couldn’t even if we tried!)
